          When designing a solution, the first step is to understand the problem:
        </p>
        <p>
        After watching the cutscene, we can see that a self-driving vehicle has 
        spilt bags of rubbish all over a factory floor! Luckily, there are a pair 
        of bins at the edge of the room that we can deposit the rubbish into. 
        However, rather than cleaning it up ourselves, what if we program the 
        robotic arm to do it for us?

          If we are going to solve our problem with the robotic arm,
          we will first need to understand its capabilities:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            There is a claw attachment on the end of the arm that can be opened
            and closed. It could be used to grasp the items of rubbish.
          </li>
          <li>
            The arm has five motors, four to move the arm around the space and
            one to open and close the claw. We could control each motor individually
            or instead use a pre-made function to move them together.
          </li>
          <li>
            We canâ€™t move this robotic arm and open/close its claw at the same time. 
            We will have to do one after the other.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </section>
    </div>
