          When designing a solution, the first step is to understand the problem:
        </p>
        <p>
        After watching the cutscene, we can see that a self-driving vehicle has 
        spilt bags of rubbish all over a factory floor! üôÄ
        </p>
        <section>
        </section>
        <p>
        Luckily, there are a pair 
        of bins at the edge of the room that we can deposit the rubbish into. 
        However, rather than cleaning it up ourselves, what if we program the 
        H.E.R.&#216; robotic arm to do it for us? ü§î

          Let's start by defining the capabilities of the H.E.R.&#216; robotic arm:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            There is a gravity wand attached to the end of the arm (don't ask us 
            how it works) that we can turn on and off. It could be turned <b>on</b> to 
            attract the items of rubbish and turned <b>off</b> to drop them into a bin. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚ôª
          </li>
          <li>
            The arm has four motors to move it around in 3D space. We could control 
            each motor individually or, instead, use a pre-made function to move them 
            together. ü¶æ‚õì
          </li>
          <li>
            The H.E.R.&#216; robot can only be programmed to perform one task at a 
            time. This means that we need to first move the gravity wand into position, 
            and then turn the gravity wand on/off. 1Ô∏è‚É£‚û°2Ô∏è‚É£
